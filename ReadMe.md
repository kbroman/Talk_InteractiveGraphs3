Talk: &ldquo;Interactive Graphics for high-dimensional genetic data&rdquo;
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/InteractiveGraphs3).

These are slides for a talk I will give for the Biostatistics trainees
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on 8 April 2013.

The slides were tested for Safari on a Mac and might look terrible in
some browsers. I have a lot more to learn about handling browser
differences.
